# My Love Affair with Tahini: From Humble Paste to Culinary Star

Tahini completely changed how I think about sesame seeds and Middle Eastern cooking.

## What is Tahini?
Tahini is simply toasted sesame seeds ground into a smooth, creamy paste. It's similar to peanut butter but made from sesame seeds with a distinct nutty flavor.

## Beyond Hummus
While tahini is famous for hummus, its uses extend far beyond:
- Salad dressings with lemon and garlic
- Creamy sauces for roasted vegetables
- Swirled into brownies for extra richness
- Mixed into yogurt for a quick dip
- Used as a base for baba ganoush

## Flavor Profile
Nutty, slightly bitter, and incredibly versatile. The quality varies greatly by brand - look for ones made from 100% sesame seeds.

## Storage Tips
Keep in the refrigerator once opened. If it separates, just stir it back together.

## My Favorite Uses
1. Tahini yogurt sauce for grilled meats
2. Lemon tahini dressing on roasted cauliflower
3. Swirled into chocolate desserts
4. Mixed with honey for a simple sweet spread
5. As a base for homemade halvah

Tahini has become one of my most-used ingredients - inexpensive, long-lasting, and incredibly versatile!
