# My Weekly Meal Planning Routine That Actually Works

Meal planning has transformed how I approach cooking and shopping. Here's my simple system:

## Sunday Planning Session
Set aside 1 hour every Sunday to plan the week's meals and make a shopping list.

## Inventory First
Always check what's already in your fridge, freezer, and pantry before planning.

## Theme-Based Planning
Choose a loose theme each week (Mediterranean, Taco Tuesday for the week, etc.)

## Balanced Variety
Aim for a mix of quick meals, new recipes, and family favorites.

## Prep Ahead
Do any chopping, marinating, or cooking that can be done in advance.

## Flexible Execution
Be willing to swap meals if plans change - the plan is a guide, not a rule.

## Benefits
- Saves money through reduced food waste
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Makes grocery shopping more efficient
- Ensures healthier, more balanced meals

Meal planning is about creating systems that work for your life and schedule!
