There's something magical about the aroma of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies wafting through the kitchen. These classic cookies have been a family favorite for generations, and for good reason - they're soft, chewy, and absolutely irresistible.

## Ingredients

* 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
* ¾ cup granulated sugar
* ¾ cup brown sugar, packed
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.
5. Gradually blend in the flour mixture until just combined.
6. Stir in chocolate chips by hand.
7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown around the edges.
9. Cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
